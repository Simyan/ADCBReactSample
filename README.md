# Introduction
This is a sample project to show case the capabilities of React. While also highlighting the libraries that will be used. The idea here is to help our team evaluate React as the potential go to choice for frontend development of our green field projects.

## What is the sample about?
The sample will show case a web application that can allow users to record their favorite TV Shows, Movies, Books & Video Games. The idea here is to take an easy to understand use case that does not require any domain knowledge so that the focus is on the technical capabilities of React.
